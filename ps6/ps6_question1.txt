Question 1

## Q1

Answer: The goals of the simulation study was to propose a test procedure of the work developed by Vuong.  Vuong derived a 
likelihood ratio test for model selection based on the information criterion by Kulback and Leibler.  This method was developed
mainly for selecting models in multiple regression.  Therefore the goals of the simulation study were to test this procedure by looking
at a 1 component mixture vs. a 2 component normal mixture and a 2 component vs a 3 component normal mixture.  Conclusions drawn 
from this test inform an empirical change to the statistic that appears to improve the rate of convergence of the limiting distribution.

## Q2

Answer: The authors decided to look at two of the most simple cases, a one and two component comparison and a two and three component comparison. 
They also decided on sample sizes that spanned from 10^1 to 10^3 with a 1000 simulations for each sample size.  Finally, 
they also chose different mixing proportions of the component distributions as well as the spacing between the components.  
I think the size of the sample and the number of simulations run for each scenario would affect the statistical power of the method the most.  
Small sample sizes and small number of replications (as referred in the paper) would reduce the statistical power, rather it would have a difficult time
to detect a small effect if one existed.  The large sample size and number of replcations conducted would reduce the likelihood of missing even the smallest affect, and
thereby increasing the statistical power.
I do not think there are data generating scenarios that the authors of this paper/study did not consider that would have been useful to consider.

## Q3

Answer: I do not think the tables presenting the results of the simulation results were not good at representing the results.
There are numerous amounts of the numbers reported, summarizing the simulation studies.  Given the number of results, 
I think that a more graphical representation would be better suited.  This would allow for easy comparison between results of 
different parameters and sample size.

## Q4

Answer: Based off of my assessment of the tables on power, Table 2 and Table 4, the results do make sense to me in terms of 
how the power varies as a function of the data generating mechanism.

## Q5

Answer: I think that the authors decided on 1000 simulations for their tests because 1000 simulations probably allowed the 
authors of the paper to be confident that the result of the simulations represent the true statistical properties of the theorem test.
I think that 10 simulations would not have been enough for this study.  We might decide that 1000 simulations is enough based off the 
what we consider to be an acceptable error required to accept or disprove a hypothesis question posed at the start of the 
simulation study.
